                <h2>Project Mercurius</h2>

                <p class="article-date">May 29, 2016</p>

                <p>I started working on project Mercurius on the 31st of March this year. It's a game that I've
                    wanted
                    to
                    build for a long time. At one point in 2010, a friend of mine and I tried getting it off the
                    ground,
                    but
                    we never got very far. Three months ago I decided it was time to try again.

                <p>Mercurius is a trading game set in the future. You buy and sell goods across the universe and try
                    to
                    amass a fortune. This is a simple base onto which many other things can be built. And simplicity
                    is
                    something I'm aiming for, because if it isn't simple it will never be built. The idea is also
                    relatively
                    easy to implement because it doesn't require advanced graphics, super-fast network protocols or
                    advanced
                    AI.

                <p>I want to create a game that people will play. In the best-case scenario, I'll make a little bit
                    of
                    money
                    off it, worst-case I'll have a great portfolio project. The odds are skewed towards the worst
                    case,
                    but
                    I don't mind that. It will be an amazing learning experience either way.

                <p>I plan to do the game design, software architecture, development, artwork and UI design myself
                    until
                    I
                    find people that are interested in joining me. Software architecture and development is
                    something I
                    can
                    do, game design seems like a more high-level version of software architecture and I have some
                    talent
                    for
                    drawing and painting.

                <p>The art aspect will be the hardest for me as I never really developed my talents in that area. By
                    art, I
                    mean storytelling, digital painting, and UI design. I've never written anything, I've never
                    painted
                    anything from imagination and I've only done very rudimentary UI design. I don't know whether I
                    can
                    do
                    these things, but it will be necessary to add flavor to the game and to give other contributors
                    a
                    better
                    idea of what the game is.

                <p>The friend I mentioned at the beginning has also indicated interest in the project and has helped
                    me
                    solidify some ideas and has come up with several great ideas himself. So far there is one design
                    document for planetary economies, there is a list of ideas and drafts and an implementation of a
                    very
                    basic version of the game.

                <p>I'm excited and curious about what's to come.
